# ðŸ”— SQL JOIN Practice

In this project, I practiced different types of SQL JOINs using simple tables.

## âœ… What I did

- Used `INNER JOIN` to get matching data from two tables
- Used `LEFT JOIN` to show all data from the left table even if thereâ€™s no match
- Used `RIGHT JOIN` to show all data from the right table even if thereâ€™s no match
- Used `FULL JOIN` to show all data from both tables with NULLs where thereâ€™s no match

## ðŸ§ª Sample Tables

- `Customers`
- `Orders`

## ðŸ“‚ Tools Used

- SQL SERVER
## ðŸ§  Purpose

To understand how JOINs work and how to get useful data from multiple tables.
