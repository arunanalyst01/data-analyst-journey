# SQL Date Functions Project

This SQL file demonstrates the use of key date and time functions in SQL Server.  
It includes examples of `CAST`, `DATEADD`, and `DATEDIFF` for real-world use cases.  
Youâ€™ll see how to calculate age, shipping duration, and time gaps between orders.  
Used on tables like `Sales.Orders` and `Sales.Employees` in a sample `SalesDB` database.  
Useful for practicing business-focused SQL queries with temporal data.
