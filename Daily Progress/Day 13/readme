 SQL String Functions Practice

This repository contains my hands-on practice with **SQL string functions** as part of my journey to become a **Data Analyst**. I focused on functions that are commonly used in data cleaning and transformation.

✅ Covered Topics

String Functions Practiced:

- `TRIM()` – Remove unwanted spaces from text
- `LEFT()` / `RIGHT()` – Extract characters from start or end
- `SUBSTRING()` – Extract text from the middle
- `REPLACE()` – Replace parts of a string
- `CONCAT()` – Combine multiple strings into one
